Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client wanted to design a website that would offer trainging packages and pratice exams to help prep someone recieve their driver's license. 

What did you do particularly well?

I handled the requirements well and I understood the assignment!

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

There isn't any part I would change or do over. I did my best at the current level I'm at... And I am proud of myself!

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I made sure I included every requirement because a user's needs are very important and must always be met for the good of the company. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software I make sure to get all the requirements before planning. Then I would speak with the client about the issues with the system, to get a feel as to why they need an upgrade.
